Test Case 1:
- Add cache levels: L1 (size 3, LRU), L2 (size 2, LFU).
- Insert data: "a" -> "apple", "b" -> "banana", "c" -> "cherry".
- Retrieve "a" and observe that it moves to the top of L1.
- Insert "d" -> "date", observe that LRU is applied at L1.

Expected Output:
Cache Level 1: a -> apple, d -> date, c -> cherry
Cache Level 2: b -> banana
